## AIM

To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) across different AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot) in a specific task: text summarization.

## Scenario:

You are part of a content curation team for an educational platform that delivers quick summaries of research papers to undergraduate students. Your task is to summarize a 500-word technical article on "The Basics of Blockchain Technology" using multiple AI platforms and prompting strategies.

Your goal is to determine which combination of prompting technique + platform provides the best summary in terms of:

Accuracy

Coherence

Simplicity

Speed

User experience

## Algorithm

# Step 1:Input Selection

Choose a common passage/article (~200–300 words) for summarization.

# Step 2: Define Prompting Techniques

1.Zero-Shot Prompt: Directly ask the model to summarize without examples.

2.Few-Shot Prompt: Provide 2–3 input–output examples, then request a new summary.

3.Chain-of-Thought Prompt: Ask the model to identify key points first, then form a structured summary.

4.Role-Based Prompt: Assign a role (e.g., “professional editor”) and request a summary.

# Step 3: Platform Execution

Run the same input + prompting techniques on:

1.ChatGPT

2.Gemini

3.Claude

4.Copilot

# Step 4: Collect Outputs

Save the generated summaries from each platform and each prompting style.

# Step 5: Evaluate Outputs using Metrics

Conciseness → Is the summary short and precise?

Coherence → Does the text flow logically?

Coverage → Are key points included?

Faithfulness → Is the summary factually correct (no hallucination)?

# Step 6: Comparative Analysis

Create a comparison table of results.

Highlight strengths and weaknesses of each prompting method and platform.

# Step 7: Conclusion

Identify which prompting method works best overall.

Suggest improvements or hybrid approaches for better summarization.

# Understanding the Process of Crafting Effective AI Prompts:

Role: Defines the specific persona or function the AI should adopt (e.g., a teacher, a programmer, or a creative writer), setting the tone and perspective for the response.
Task: Outlines the precise objective or action the AI is expected to perform (e.g., summarizing text, generating a story, or answering a question), providing a clear goal.
Instructions: Offers detailed, step-by-step guidance on how the task should be executed, including any specific requirements or constraints (e.g., word count, tone, or format).
Context: Provides relevant background information or situational details to ensure the AI understands the scenario, enhancing the relevance and accuracy of the output.
Input: Represents the raw data, query, or user-provided information that the AI processes to generate a response, acting as the starting point for the interaction.

# The Importance of AI Prompt Engineering
Improves Model Performance: Well-crafted prompts help AI models understand context, reducing errors and increasing the relevance of responses.
Customizes Outputs: Tailored prompts allow for specific, user-driven outputs making AI more versatile across industries.
Reduces Bias: Careful prompt design can mitigate biases in AI outputs by framing questions and instructions thoughtfully.
Enhances User Experience: Clear and effective prompts lead to more satisfying and meaningful AI interactions.
Streamlines Automation: Optimized prompts make routine tasks more efficient, saving time and resources.
Supports Ethical AI: Prompt engineering can incorporate ethical guidelines, promoting fairness and minimizing harmful outputs



## Result
Thus, the summarized Result section based on the experiment using the three prompt types (Straightforward, Tabular Format, Missing Word) and two AI platforms (ChatGPT and Claude).
